Read 10001 frames from week10_IR.trr (time 0 to 100 ps)
Read reference structure for fit from week10_IR.tpr
Read index groups from week10_IR_multi.ndx

Analysis group is 'POPC_single' (134 atoms)
Fit group is 'POPC_single' (134 atoms)
Analysis is non-mass weighted
Fit is non-mass weighted
Diagonalized the 402x402 covariance matrix
Trace of the covariance matrix before diagonalizing: 2.28642
Trace of the covariance matrix after diagonalizing: 2.28642

Wrote 402 eigenvalues to week11_eigenvalues.xvg
Wrote reference structure to week11_eigenvectors.trr
Wrote average structure to average.pdb and week11_eigenvectors.trr
Wrote eigenvectors 1 to 402 to week11_eigenvectors.trr
